# Introduction
`GPUTB` is an open-source software package designed to construct orthogonal Hamiltonians using machine learning SK parameters. It supports energy band structures of density functional types as learning targets.

# Contributors
GPUTB is developed by Prof. Jian Sun's group (https://sun.nju.edu.cn) at the School of Physics at Nanjing University.
